```$ build-scripts/build.sh x86```

and can create packages of the following types:
- DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian)
- RPM (CentOS, Fedora)
- ArchLinux 

The packages are signed and made available as Github releases 
and via the apt repository described in software/README.

During the build the GitHub release and version information are compiled into the binary.
