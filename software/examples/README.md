# Usage examples for Infinite Noise

## Integrate the binary to python

See the python examples `serial-numbers.py` and `randomserver.py` to see how you could integrate it with python.

#### serial-numbers.py
An extended version of this script was used to generate the serial numbers of all Infinite Noise's made by 13-37.org. The numbers generated by this simpler one are not guaranteed to be unique, thats why I use the UNIQUE constraint of a database when storing them.

This simple version just prints the serials to stdout. Call like this:

    $ ./serial-numbers.py -c 3 -l 8
    0A8BBA15
    0341F762
    813DC0BD

#### randomserver.py

A simple webserver based on the web.py framework to serve random data via a REST interface. An example is hosted at https://rng.13-37.org (running on a Raspberry Pi in Amsterdam, thanks to pcextreme.nl!)

It has only two resources: `/get` and `/status`.
